Classify your Subreddit Post by Machine Learning!

There are hundreds and thousands of posts per day on reddit.com and we definitely want computers to be able to “recognize” each post by its subreddit category for multiple usages!
But how?

Machine learning algorithms can easily help! In this project, we showcase how this is done by machine learning. Two popular kinds of subreddit posts are scrapped from reddit.com: Boardgames and True reddits. NLP is used next to analyze the word frequency for each post and a model is built on top of that to predict which category the post belongs to. The parameters are fine tuned later to optimize results. 96 of 100 posts can be categorized correctly. 

I believe there are more we can work to expand the results to a more diverse and in depth application.
